# devops-assignment-02

## Instructions:
- Create a backend service (preferably in Nodejs or Python) that will perform the following things:
- Create REST APIs to perform CRUD operations
- Data can be stored in memory (no need of DB)
- Application should be dockerized
- Setup CI to build a docker image whenever code is pushed on the “main” branch (can use GitHub, Gitlab, etc.)

## Our expectations for this challenge include:
- Source code that we can review and execute with minimal efforts
- Documentation, where relevant. (README file)
- Incorporation of Software Engineering best practices and design patterns, where relevant. (ex. architecture design from a network security perspective)
- If at any point something is unclear or you prefer a different approach, please document (code and README) and explain why.
